## Kubernetes: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for orchestrating containers, ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

### Core Concepts

* **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit of computing, consisting of one or more containers.
* **Node:** A worker machine that runs containerized applications.
* **Cluster:** A group of nodes that work together to run containerized applications.
* **Service:** An abstraction layer for a set of pods that provides a stable network endpoint.
* **Deployment:** Manages the replication and updates of Pods.
* **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of pod replicas.
* **Namespace:** Isolates groups of resources within a cluster.

### Installation

**Kubernetes Installation Options:**

1. **Kubernetes Distribution:**
   - **Kubernetes:** Install Kubernetes directly from the official documentation.
   - **Kubeadm:** A tool for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters.
   - **K3s:** A lightweight Kubernetes distribution for small-scale deployments.
   - **Minikube:** A local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.

2. **Cloud-Based Kubernetes:**
   - **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** A managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud Platform.
   - **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** A managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
   - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** A managed Kubernetes service on Azure.

### Basic Usage

**Basic Commands:**

* **kubectl:** The primary command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.
  - `kubectl get pods`: List pods in a namespace.
  - `kubectl get services`: List services in a namespace.
  - `kubectl get deployments`: List deployments in a namespace.
  - `kubectl run my-app --image my-image`: Create a new pod.
  - `kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort`: Expose a deployment as a service.

**Creating a Deployment:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**Creating a Service:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

   Replace `<master-node-ip>:<port>` with the IP address and port of the master node.

**Basic Usage:**

1. **Check Cluster Status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```

2. **Create a Namespace:**
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace my-app
   ```

3. **Deploy a Simple Application:**
   - Create a Deployment YAML file (e.g., `my-deployment.yaml`):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: my-app
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: my-app
       template:

     ```
   - Apply the Deployment:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
     ```

4. **Expose the Application:**
   - Create a Service YAML file (e.g., `my-service.yaml`):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: my-service
     spec:
       selector:
